# CodeHosp: GitHub for Medical Research 🏥🔬

## The Problem: Medical Research's Reproducibility Crisis

> "50% of published medical studies can't be reproduced. We're wasting billions on research that can't be verified."

Current issues in medical research:
- 📊 Raw data locked away in private files
- 💻 Analysis code never shared
- 🔍 No easy way to verify findings
- ⚠️ Statistical errors go unnoticed

## The Solution: CodeHosp

CodeHosp is a collaborative platform that brings transparency and reproducibility to medical research by combining:

- **GitHub's version control** for research code
- **Google Drive's accessibility** for datasets
- **Automated verification** of results

## Key Features

### 🔍 Study Verification Engine
- Automatically reruns analyses to confirm published results
- Flags statistical errors and data anomalies
- Provides reproducibility score for each study

### 🏆 Incentivized Peer Review
- Earn "PeerPoints" for reproducing studies and catching errors
- Leaderboard highlights top contributors
- Verified badges for high-reputation researchers

### 📂 Research Repository
- Structured storage for datasets, code, and documentation
- Version control for all research artifacts

## Example Workflow

1. **Researcher Uploads Study**
   ```
   From the website of CodeHosp
   ```

2. **System Verifies Results**
   ```
   ✔️ Analysis ran successfully
   ⚠️ Warning: p-value adjustment not applied
   🔍 3 outliers detected in control group
   ```

3. **Community Improves Research**
   ```python
   # Peer suggests improved analysis
   def better_analysis(data):
       # Fixed multiple comparison issue
       return statsmodels.stats.multitest.fdrcorrection(data)
   ```

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend & Backend**: NextJS
- **Database**: FireStore + Supabase

**Make medical research transparent, reproducible, and collaborative.**
